      operationId: truths.read_all # "truths.read_all" defines the Python import path/function that will respond to an HTTP GET /api/truths request. The "truths.read_all" portion can go as deep as you need to in order to connect a function to the HTTP request. Something like "<package_name>.<package_name>.<package_name>.<function_name>" would work just as well.
